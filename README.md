# Balora

## Balora IoT Board Library

The Balora IoT Platform Library is a comprehensive library developed for the Balora IoT platform, which combines the power of LoRa, Bluetooth, WiFi, IMU, Battery, and the ESP32-PICO-D4 MCU. This library provides a unified interface and a set of convenient functions to simplify the development of IoT applications using the Balora custom board.

## LoRa Communication

The LoRa mesh implementation is carried out by assigning a timeslot to each of the nodes. The node number defines the time slot. Each slot is assigned per second. Example: Node B3 is assigned the 3rd second slot.
